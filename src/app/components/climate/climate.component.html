      <h2>Extreme Rainfall</h2>

      <div class="event">
        <h2>10.04.2023: Floods in southern Israel cause two deaths and damage</h2>
        <p>A powerful weather system for April occurred from the 10th to the 13th of the month, bringing heavy rains accompanied by widespread thunderstorms, heavy hail, and strong wind gusts. On April 10th, the eastern Mediterranean was at the front of an upper-level trough with a strong jet stream moving towards the region from North Africa. This caused moisture and cloud cover to be transported from central Africa to the eastern Mediterranean. Due to atmospheric instability, there was significant cloud development in southern Israel, mainly during the afternoon and evening hours of April 10th. As a result, heavy rains fell in this area, particularly in the southern Negev and central Arava. At the Paran station, more than 30 mm of rain was measured within one hour and more than 20 mm within half an hour. In Yotvata, more than 20 mm fell in an hour, and in Neot Smadar, about 10 mm was measured within 20 minutes. The heavy rains caused floods in the southern wadis, and two young people were killed when their vehicle was swept away by a flood in Nahal Tzihor. Dozens of others were rescued by emergency forces. The floods caused damage to roads and blocked the route to Eilat for about 12 hours.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="event">
        <h2>End of May to mid-June 2023: A series of unusual rain events</h2>
        <p>The first event, from May 27 to 29, brought the largest amounts of rain - 20 mm were measured in Mitzpe Ramon, and more than 10 mm in the eastern Negev, Jordan Valley, and eastern mountain ridge. The rains were accompanied by frequent thunderstorms and heavy hail, fell at high intensities, and caused stream flows and floods.</p>
        <p>The second event was on June 1-2 and included various weather phenomena - heat waves and record-breaking wind gusts (detailed in separate paragraphs), sandstorms, and rains. These fell in small amounts (usually up to 1 mm) but with widespread distribution accompanied by thunderstorms.</p>
        <p>The third event was on June 8-9 and also included a heat wave with temperatures of 38 to 40°C and several waves of rain across the country in amounts of up to 5 mm and thunderstorms.</p>
        <p>The last event was on June 13 and included rain and thunderstorms following the passage of a southern sharav (heat wave) depression accompanied by a jet stream. As the path of the sharav depression was southerly, no significant warming was felt across the country. Rains fell in amounts between a few tenths of a millimeter to several millimeters and were accompanied by thunderstorms.
          Each event in itself is unusual for this time of year with the widespread rain distribution, reaching deep into the Negev, the simultaneous thunderstorms, and the fact that the rain did not follow a daily pattern. The clouds were accompanied by phenomena of rapid wind intensifications and localized haze. Such a sequence of events at this time is almost unprecedented.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Extreme Heat Waves</h2>

      <div class="event">
        <h2>12-20.08.2023: Heat wave with an unprecedented sequence of warm nights For about 8 to 9 days</h2>
        <p>A static upper-level ridge was present over the eastern Mediterranean, while in the lower layers, the seasonal Persian trough prevailed with westerly flows. This caused the formation of a thick inversion layer, below which abundant cloud cover prevailed during night and morning hours, especially in the coastal plain, and high humidity accumulated.</p>
        <p>As a result, nights in the coastal plain and northern valleys were very warm with minimum temperatures of 26 to 29°C (which are 3 to 6°C above average). The high nighttime temperatures combined with relative humidity of 75% to 80% left moderate heat stress at night, following heavy heat stress during the day in these areas.</p>
        <p>These sequences of eight days with the mentioned heat stress and warm nights are unprecedented. Additionally, it should be noted that regarding the highest minimum temperature measured during the event, there were several stations where the record was slightly broken (such as Beit Dagan with 29.0°C and Negba with 28.2°C), and in others, this was the second or third highest value.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="event">
        <h2>01-02.06.2023: Severe heat wave with record-breaking temperatures for June</h2>
        <p>On June 1st, a heat wave prevailed with temperatures reaching 36 to 38°C in the coastal plain and 38 to 40°C in the lowlands and northern Negev. The warming was halted in the afternoon with the wind shifting to strong northwesterly (a review of this is in the wind chapter), but the following day saw another heat wave, this time with higher intensity and temperatures of more than 40°C in most areas, except for the mountains, for many hours.</p>
        <p>In the central and southern coastal plain, maximum temperatures of 43 to 44°C were measured, and similar values were recorded in large parts of the Jordan Valley, Arava, and Dead Sea (45.5°C was measured in Gilgal). In the northern Negev and northern valleys, 40 to 42°C were measured, and similar temperatures were recorded even in the coastal strip.</p>
        <p>In Beit Dagan (43.8°C), Negba (43.7°C), and Kvutzat Yavne (43.1°C), the record value for June was broken since the beginning of measurements more than 60 years ago.</p>

      <h2>Extreme Winds</h2>

      <div class="event">
        <h2>13.03.2023: Extreme and sudden wind gusts in Ashkelon cause two deaths</h2>
        <p>In mid-March, a rain system affected our region, bringing several dozen millimeters of rain. At its beginning, on the evening of March 13th, developed cloud cover formed in the southeastern Mediterranean, north of Sinai. This cloud cover advanced towards the north-northeast, and within it, an exceptionally powerful cumulonimbus cloud formed and intensified, reaching the Ashkelon area. This caused a sharp and sudden strengthening of winds that had been weak most of the day.</p>
        <p>At the station in Ashkelon port, the maximum wind gust increased from 19 km/h at 23:20 to 100 km/h at 23:30, and a few minutes later, a maximum gust of 108 km/h was recorded. As the cloud passed, there was a very rapid weakening of the winds. The wind strength was not unusual, but the sharp increase in wind speed was exceptional compared to historical measurements in this area.</p>
        <p>The strong wind gusts caused a crane to collapse in Ashkelon port, resulting in two fatalities.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="event">
        <h2>01.06.2023: Waves of extreme wind gusts</h2>
        <p>On June 1st, there was a significant warming and a heat wave prevailed across the country. Around 13:00, a significant strengthening of northwestern winds occurred in the coastal plain, accompanied by gusts reaching 50 to 70 km/h and locally even more: 100 km/h at Ben Gurion Airport and 90 km/h at Ashkelon port. The wind intensification happened almost simultaneously at stations in the coastal strip and coastal plain, and later the strong winds also reached the western slopes of the mountain range, albeit with lower intensities (gusts of 30 to 50 km/h), and the northern Negev. The strong winds raised a lot of dust into the air, and at Ben Gurion Airport, visibility temporarily dropped below 500 meters.</p>
        <p>In the afternoon and evening, there was again a significant strengthening of winds, shifting to northerly - northwesterly, but this time gradually from north to south - first in the northern coastal plain, then in the central and southern coastal plain, and later in the evening in the Negev and Arava (19:30-20:00). Wind gusts reached 60 to 80 km/h in extensive areas, not just in the coastal plain and lowlands. The strong winds caused dust storms, especially in the south of the country, and a real sandstorm entered the southern Arava, causing the suspension of activities at Ramon Airport (Timna).</p>
        <p>In several areas of the country, especially in the coastal plain and lowlands, records were broken for wind gusts for late May and the month of June since the beginning of measurements at automatic stations (about 20 to 25 years ago).</p>
